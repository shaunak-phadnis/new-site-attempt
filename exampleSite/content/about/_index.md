I am a 3rd year PhD student at UMass Linguistics. I mainly work in Formal Pragmatics which is ideal because I find communication confusing and fascinating. I like to think about how speakers are able to communicate various messages/signals/intentions without actually stating them explicitly. Due to this, I also like to think about Social Meaning and Philosophy of Langauge. In general I think about how conversations work. I also have a latent interest in how events are represented in our cognitive architecture. I am big fan of LoTH. 

Before coming to UMass I worked as a Conversational UX designer at a start-up. Before that I did my masters at EFLU, Hyderabad. Before that, I did my bachelors in Mathematics. 

In my free time I like to read comic books, cook delicious meals, and write music.
